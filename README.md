# A simple React/Redux ToDos App

I created this app only for learning purposes to get more famliliar with redux. To run the web app, install all npm modules first:

```
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```
npm run start:dev
```

And watch out for code changes:

```
webpack --watch
```

The application should be running on `localhost:80881`.
